Refactor to move functions into a ChangeNotifier class that will be used internally by the HomeScreen widget. The HomeScreen will be rebuilt by listening to the ChangeNotifier, so the HomeScreen should turn into a StatelessWidget. The HomeScreenState should be created in the ChangeNotifierProvider. The HomeScreenState constructor can accept the BuildContext so that it can use for internal logic. Other dependencies of the HomeScreenState should be provided by get_it from inside the class.
