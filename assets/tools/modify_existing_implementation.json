  "prompt": "Given this existing implementation:\n<implementation>\n{{IMPLEMENTATION}}\n</implementation>\n\nModify the implementation to satisfy the requirements below:  \n<feature>\n{{REQUIREMENTS}}\n</feature>\n\nPlease keep the following in mind as you make your modifications:\n\n- The source code of each file in your response must be wrapped in a Markdown code block to be well formatted. Specify the proper language for each code block.\n\n- The implementation provided above contains multiple files. Each file has the following format:\n---<Full file path>---  \n```<proper language>\nSource code\n```\n\n- Your response must contain multiple parts, one for each modified file. Each part should use this same format:\n---<Full file path>---\n```<proper language> \nModified source code\n```\n\n- The modified code should be of professional, production-quality. Follow software engineering best practices around code structure, naming conventions, and comments.\n\n- Preserve the behavior of the existing implementation except for the modifications needed to satisfy the new requirements.\n\n<scratchpad>\nBefore you begin modifying the code, take a moment to:\n1) Carefully read through the existing implementation to understand its current structure and behavior. \n2) Analyze the new feature requirements to determine what changes need to be made.\n3) Consider how to implement the changes while maintaining code quality and following best practices.\n</scratchpad>\n\nAfter making your modifications, please review the code to check:\n- Does it satisfy all the new requirements?\n- Is it free of bugs and errors? \n- Is it readable, well-structured, and properly commented?\n- Does it follow language-specific conventions and best practices?\n\nIf you are satisfied that your modified implementation meets the bar for production-quality code, please provide the complete modified source code in your response, using the specified format.",
